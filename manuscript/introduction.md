# Introduction

XML doesn't get much respect from the Rails community. It's
*enterprisey*. In the Ruby world that other markup language YAML (YAML
Ain't Markup Language) and data interchange format JSON (JavaScript
Object Notation) get a heck of a lot more attention. However, use of XML
is a fact of life for many projects, especially when it comes to
interoperability with legacy systems. Luckily, Ruby on Rails gives us
some pretty good functionality related to XML.

## Quick Foreword

This mini-book started off as an extraction from [The Rails 4 Way](http://leanpub.com/tr4w), provoked by the removal of the material from the latest edition of that series: [The Rails 5 Way](http://leanpub.com/tr5w).

I didn't delete the content from The Rails Way because it was useless. It' just that based on informal polling, most Rails developers don't have to deal with XML in their day-to-day responsibilities. Given the size and scope of The Rails 5 Way (over 1000 pages), something had to go. XML was an easy choice, especially given the opportunity to make it available as a mini-book.

The best thing about extracting this material into its own book is that I can (over the course of time, of course) enhance and expand on the subject in a way that I would not be able to do if it were simply part of a larger reference book. For instance, in The Rails 4 Way I simply mentioned Nokogiri in passing, but in this book I plan to give it its own chapter. I also plan to take some of the work that I've done lately using Twilio and turn it into a full-fledged case study of using Builder. Again, these are efforts that would not be possible in a broader book.

My sincere hope for you, dear reader, is that if XML is part of your daily reality, that you are able to rely on this book as both a primer and reference companion. Just like the rest of the books in the series.
